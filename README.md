Hello, I'm Stanislav Kir [KSGiNET], a self-taught programmer. ©2024
I'm interested in the world of Python312, neural networks, and projects in the field of artificial intelligence.
Currently, I'm exploring new technologies and languages, diving into the Python world and its possibilities.
I'm eager to collaborate on projects related to artificial intelligence development and creating smart solutions.
You can reach me at ksginet@gmail.com or through Telegram: [@ctackup](https://t.me/ctackup).
When not behind the computer, I enjoy classical music, cook inspiring dishes, and love fantastic movies.
